Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set

The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011) when the power plant was set to work with a full load. A combined-cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has an effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three of the ambient variables affect the GT performance.

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables

Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C.

Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 millibar.

Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16%.

Exhaust Vacuum (V) in the range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg.

Net hourly electrical energy output (PE) 420.26-495.76 MW.

Let’s build a neural network using functional API to predict Net hourly electrical energy output (PE) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) with Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP) and Relative Humidity (RH) as inputs
